# GZ-Aesthetics

Why are we doing this?<br>
To practice the knowlage we got during the course.

How I expected the challenge to go.<br>
I was expected that challenge will be team work when everyone has his own task, and after via GitHub we marge to gather all in one, and got final result as a team. 

What went well? / What didn't go as planned? <br>
Sometimes it is very hard to find error a specially if it is spelling problem. 

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project<br>
I planing convert it to working web page in next 4 month.
